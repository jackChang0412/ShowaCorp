Background

  To improve our brand image, attract foreign customers, and meet the operational requirements of our future international locations, we must develop a website to expand our business to other countries. The website will be primarily in English and designed for an international audience to ensure that consumers worldwide can easily access the restaurant's information. Our goal is to establish the restaurant's online brand image, showcase its features, and increase the conversion rate of global customers.

Goal

 1. Support for International Market Expansion: Customers can easily know the restaurant's information in English.
 2. High-quality brand image: Emphasize the restaurant's features and values to attract international customers.
 3. Enhance the user experience: Ensure the website is easy to use so customers can quickly find important information (menu, address, reservation).
